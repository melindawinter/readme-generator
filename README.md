## Installation

If you would like to use this generator, please clone my project. Make sure you have node.js installed on your computer. You can find the download here <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>.

## Usage

Once you have a cloned version, open it up in VS Code or another editor. Open up your terminal and make sure you are in the correct directory folder. Type "node index.js" into the command line and press Enter. Type in an answer or use the arrow keys to choose from a drop-down. When you have answered all of the questions, a formatted README file will be generated for you.
